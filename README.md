To setup things, first install node/npm, then, in both the client and server folders, run:

`$ npm install`

To run the React server (on port 3000), run:

`$ npm start`

in the client folder. This server provides the UI code, and sends requests to the Express server for backend, database-related things.

Do the same in the server folder to run the Express server (on port 8000). This server handles backend.

Whenever you edit code, the respective server will restart to reflect your changes.
